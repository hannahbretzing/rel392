                                <p>I loved this <a href="https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/80-252/the-cross-of-christ" target="_blank">sermon!</a> I thought it was so interesting that the author talks about unseals and what Peter means when he says he is writing in his own hand. I’ve always thought that was an odd thing to say. Of course, Peter would be writing, who else would be? I didn’t know that there would have been a professional scribe writing down what Peter is saying. This gives a lot more meaning to when Peter states that he is writing in his own hand. It means whatever he is about to write, he thought was important enough to come directly through him instead of being dictated by him and then written down by a scribe. Since he was not a professional, his writing would have been much bigger and sloppier than the scribe. It would have been very obvious that Peter himself had written it. I like how the author of this sermon goes on to explain the parable that Peter sees in his writing. He states that there are people who are going to be very concerned with how things look. In Peter's time, these people were those trying to bridge Judaism and Christianity. They wanted to keep the law of Moses, the fence laws, and also try to learn from Christ's teachings. These people wanted to follow all their old traditions to keep up appearances and avoid taking a stand. By writing these words himself and not having a scribe write it for him, he is stating that he doesn’t care about appearances. He doesn’t care how it looks. Unlike the people unwilling to take a stand for Christianity to keep with appearances and avoid being persecuted, Peter does not care how others may view him. He is ok with his sloppy handwriting because he knows it is not the appearance of things that matter but intent. Peter goes on to say, “May it never be that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.” I love this quote! This quote shows what is important to Peter. While others may boast about bringing people into Judaism, appearances, or other things, Peter will only boast about the cross of Christ. I think this is something I could do better at. Focusing less on appearance and more on Christ and the cross.  </p>
